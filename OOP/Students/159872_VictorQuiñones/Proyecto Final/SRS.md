# INTRODUCTION

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to describe the software requirements of specification for the management of every article involved in the high school CBTis 270  but in three specific aspects like system ABC for be implemented in the library, system ABC for be implemented in the workshops also system ABC for be implemented in the cellar computational. Also, in this document every requirement will be detailed and explained.

## Scope
“Multifunctional system  ABC” will be a product of software wil be a product of sotware to management of resources of the high school cbtis 270 , like books in the library ,or tools in the workshops of maintaniance or electricity  as well as   accesesories in the cellar computational  implemented with  the abc of programming

## Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations 
ABC: ups, downs and chages 
multifunctional: have several functions for diferents uses in distints aspects

# OVERRALL DESCRIPTION 
## Product perspective 
The multifunctional system ABC consist in general, about the use and management of resources of school as well as the implementation of the same because in this way the system will be a base of the good resource management through of ups, downs and changes.
## product functions 
The main function of this system is to provide control in every aspect about the resources of CBTis 270. Provide information at administrator of library, technical support, and workshop. 

| USE CASES | DESCRIPTION |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Select your profile | the user of the system can choose according to his domain |
| registration of new article | the user can make a new registration in the inventory system |
| modify data of the article | the user can modify the status of the articles as well as make changes |
| Delete the article | the user can remove articles that have already been captured |
| search for articles | the user can search for articles that belong to his class or his profile |




## User characteristics
There are some user in the multifunctional system ABC like:

| User | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| End user | this user is responsible for making highs, lows and changes according to their domain area |
| Administrator | This user has access to all domain areas and see your information |


 
## Constraints 
-Different profiles are required since users can only enter their domain area
-An access is required as administrator of the system so as to have total control
-The system can be distributed and may cause connection errors to the database

## Assumptions and dependencies 

| Assumptions and dependencies | Description | 
| ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| Assumption 1 | the user requires to login in their relevant profile |
| Assumption 2 | only the administrator can use all the system information |
| Dependencies 1 | Database connection |
| Dependencies 2 | User and password |
	
	
# SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS 

## external interface requirements 
-The system must interact from 3 user profiles library, computational cellar, workshop as well as an administrator profile which have privillegios with their respective domain areas. finally interact with the database
## user interface 
## hardware interface 
## comunications interfaces
