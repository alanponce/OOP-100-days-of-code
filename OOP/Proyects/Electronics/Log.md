## Log

### R1D1 
Started a CRUD for a Electronics store. I'm struggling with identifying which methods can the classes do. But I think i will re-read the chapter 2
Have the SRS, made a Use Case, of the idea of how the system should work.

###R1D2
Continuing with the SRS, My idea is eliminate Administrator and owner. They have the same methods, only that Administrator con confirms orders of the clients.
These may be pretty useless, because in a tech Store, there are hundreds of purchases a day. So if the Admin[Administrator] must confirm
all of them, then it will saturate the admin of requests.
